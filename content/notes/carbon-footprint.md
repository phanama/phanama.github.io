The recently famous young environmental activist, [Greta Thunberg](https://twitter.com/GretaThunberg), has been campainging about reducing carbon footprints.

She made headlines in the internet when taking [train back home](https://web.archive.org/web/20200211070314/https:/twitter.com/GretaThunberg/status/1205969006982815751) and [sail boat accross the Atlantic](https://web.archive.org/web/20191216022210/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyage_of_Greta_Thunberg) instead of [planes](https://web.archive.org/web/20200114221407/https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/2019/7/25/8881364/greta-thunberg-climate-change-flying-airline). She even got her own [Time's person of the year issue](https://time.com/person-of-the-year-2019-greta-thunberg/) at the age of 16!



### What is carbon footprint anyway?

Despite its name, [carbon footprint](https://web.archive.org/web/20200112055430/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_footprint) doesn't solely mean the "carbon" emission. It also [includes](https://web.archive.org/web/20090511102744/http://www.carbontrust.co.uk/solutions/CarbonFootprinting/what_is_a_carbon_footprint.htm) other greenhouse gases (GHG for short) emissions such as methane and nitrous oxide, either directly or indirectly, which then are converted into the carbon equivalent of the emission. "Carbon" and "GHG" can be seen interchangeably in this writing.

We can see it as an **accounting tool** to show **how much ecological impact** something (specifically human) **brings to the nature** through the GHG emission.

Anyone can have their own carbon footprints, either individually or collectively.

### What causes carbon footprints?

_Anything we do, really._
As a (living) individual, we already have it by default, either directly or indirectly. As we breathe we emit CO2; digesting our foods also produces methane as the byproduct; physical activities; eating beef (it _indirectly_ counts to our GHG emission, as the beef lived and emit GHGs to serve its purpose of being eaten by us); and even when we're still being concieved, what our mothers do to nourish us accounts to our own footprint.

As a collective individuals (we all humans), what we do together also count for our GHG emission. We ship products; organize concerts; lit fireworks everytime the Earth passes the same spot again relative to the Sun; burn coal to produce energy; fly planes to travel; anything that we do together.

### How much GHG do we emit?

Everyone has different numbers. It depends on our lifestyles; the country we live in, what we eat, what we use to commute, the goods we consume, how we consume them, and many more. There's a statistic of the [CO2 emission per person per country](https://web.archive.org/web/20200213115205/https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a7/CO2_emissions_per_capita%2C_2017_(Our_World_in_Data).svg) showing varying numbers on different
countries.

An average Indonesian emits up to 2.5 tons per year, while the [average Joe](https://web.archive.org/web/20150912211827/https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/average_Joe) can emit up to 20 tons per year. (What's with the name? Even the name Joe is [averagely popular](https://web.archive.org/web/20170125180636/https://names.mongabay.com/baby-names/application/rank-M-US-joe.html) in America; not to offend the Joes out there :D).

Collectively, we emit 

*GHG emission numbers are typically measured in accordance to standards like the [ISO 14064](https://web.archive.org/web/20151224053516/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_14064). There's also an online [calculator to estimate household GHG emission](https://web.archive.org/web/20200208161958/https://www3.epa.gov/carbon-footprint-calculator/).

### Why does our carbon footprint matter?

Well.. the more GHG we emit, the more it impacts the nature.
GHGs [absorb and emit thermal energy radiated by the Earth](https://web.archive.org/web/20100430143234/https://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/syr/ar4_syr_appendix.pdf), causing the [Greenhouse Effect](https://web.archive.org/web/20191227221737/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_effect), trapping heat from the Earth, thus warming our Earth. Imagine it like using blankets when we're cold, the blanket traps heat to keep us warm!

The greenhouse effect itself isn't harmful to us, it actually is helpful. Without such effect from our GHGs, the our Earth would be freezing at −18°C! But, too much of it then our Earth would be similar to the hell planet [Venus](https://web.archive.org/web/20191224054451/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Venus).

We may guess now, the more GHG we emit, the warmer our Earth will be. The nature itself does reabsorb the GHGs through natural process such as growing plants; plants traps store carbons in their biomass. They are our [carbon sink](https://web.archive.org/web/20200130171510/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_sink). But, they are also doing it really slowly; the rate that our nature reabsorb GHGs really lags behind the rate we emit them back to the nature, they only absorb
approximately [40% of what we emit](https://web.archive.org/web/20170811191854/https://royalsociety.org/~/media/royal_society_content/policy/publications/2001/9996.pdf). The rest? Stays in the atmosphere to warm our planet up.

If we continue emitting GHG to the point that it's too hot for us to live in here, then we're doomed! Even before we reach such temperature, the rising sea would already bring impact by submerging coasts and lowlands, wreaking havoc on our world economy!

So, why does it matter? Because this Earth we live in is our home. We live together in this piece of space rock; Earth a shared living space for us all, we share the same atmosphere! What we do here might indirectly affect the other guys on the other side of the Earth. What we emit here today will impact some generations somewhere in the future.
