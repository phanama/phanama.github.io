The recently famous young environmental activist, [Greta Thunberg](https://twitter.com/GretaThunberg), has been campainging about reducing carbon footprints. She made headlines in the internet when taking [train back home](https://web.archive.org/web/20200211070314/https:/twitter.com/GretaThunberg/status/1205969006982815751) and [sail boat accross the Atlantic](https://web.archive.org/web/20191216022210/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyage_of_Greta_Thunberg) instead of [planes](https://web.archive.org/web/20200114221407/https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/2019/7/25/8881364/greta-thunberg-climate-change-flying-airline). She even got her own [Time's person of the year issue](https://time.com/person-of-the-year-2019-greta-thunberg/) at the age of 16.

## What is carbon footprint anyway?

Despite its name, [carbon footprint](https://web.archive.org/web/20200112055430/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_footprint) doesn't solely mean the "carbon" emission. It also [includes](https://web.archive.org/web/20090511102744/http://www.carbontrust.co.uk/solutions/CarbonFootprinting/what_is_a_carbon_footprint.htm) other greenhouse gases (GHG for short) emissions such as methane and nitrous oxide, either directly or indirectly, which then are converted into the carbon equivalent of the emission. "Carbon" and "GHG" can be seen interchangeably in this writing.

We can see it as an **accounting tool** to show **how much ecological impact** something (specifically human) **brings to the nature** through the GHG emission.

## What causes carbon footprints?

_Anything we do, really._
As a (living) individual, we already have it by default, either directly or indirectly. As we breathe we emit CO2; digesting our foods also produces methane as the byproduct; physical activities; eating beef (it _indirectly_ counts to our GHG emission, as the beef lived and emit GHGs to serve its purpose of being eaten by us); and even when we're still being concieved, what our mothers do to nourish us accounts to our own footprint.

As a collective individuals (we all humans), what we do together also count for our GHG emission. We ship products; organize concerts; lit fireworks everytime the Earth passes the same spot again relative to the Sun; burn coal to produce energy; fly planes to travel; anything that we do together.

## How much GHG we emit

Any can have their own carbon footprints, either individually or collectively.

Everyone has different numbers. It depends on our lifestyles; the country we live in, what we eat, what we use to commute, the goods we consume, how we consume them, and many more. There's a statistic of the [CO2 emission per person per country](https://web.archive.org/web/20200213115205/https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a7/CO2_emissions_per_capita%2C_2017_(Our_World_in_Data).svg) showing varying numbers on different
countries.

An average Indonesian emits up to 2.5 tons per year, while the [average Joe](https://web.archive.org/web/20150912211827/https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/average_Joe) can emit up to 20 tons per year. (What's with the name? Even the name Joe is [averagely popular](https://web.archive.org/web/20170125180636/https://names.mongabay.com/baby-names/application/rank-M-US-joe.html) in America; not to offend the Joes out there).

Collectively, we emit ~35 Gigatons of CO2 per year [as per 2017](https://web.archive.org/web/20200217024955/https://ourworldindata.org/co2-and-other-greenhouse-gas-emissions). That sounds [a lot](https://web.archive.org/web/20191222193450/https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/life-unbounded/the-crazy-scale-of-human-carbon-emission/).

*GHG emission numbers are typically measured in accordance to standards like the [ISO 14064](https://web.archive.org/web/20151224053516/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_14064). There's also an online [calculator to estimate household GHG emission](https://www.carbonfootprint.com/calculator.aspx)

## Why our carbon footprint matter

Well.. the more GHG we emit, the more it impacts the nature.
GHGs [absorb and emit thermal energy radiated by the Earth](https://web.archive.org/web/20100430143234/https://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/syr/ar4_syr_appendix.pdf), causing the [Greenhouse Effect](https://web.archive.org/web/20191227221737/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_effect), trapping heat from the Earth and bouncing it back, thus warming our Earth. Imagine it like using blankets when we're cold, the blanket traps body heat to keep us warm.

![](https://web.archive.org/web/20191002055420if_/https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/04/Greenhouse-effect-t2.svg/640px-Greenhouse-effect-t2.svg.png "Greenhouse Effect")_Credit: [A loose necktie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_effect#/media/File:Greenhouse-effect-t2.svg)_

The greenhouse effect itself isn't harmful to us, it actually is helpful. Without such effect from our GHGs, the our Earth would be freezing at −18°C. But, too much of it then our Earth would be similar to the hell planet [Venus](https://web.archive.org/web/20191224054451/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Venus).

We may guess now, the more GHG we emit, the warmer our Earth will be. The nature itself does reabsorb the GHGs through natural process such as growing plants; plants traps store carbons in their biomass. They are our [carbon sink](https://web.archive.org/web/20200130171510/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_sink).

Before industrial revolution, the nature actually already has its own carbon cycle which is somewhat balanced; what the nature emits are absorbed back by the nature. We humans are [disrupting that balance](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/326/5958/1394.abstract); the rate that our nature reabsorb GHGs really lags behind the rate we emit them to the nature, they only absorb
approximately [40% of what we emit](https://web.archive.org/web/20170811191854/https://royalsociety.org/~/media/royal_society_content/policy/publications/2001/9996.pdf). The rest? Stays in the atmosphere to warm our planet up.

Here's what our CO2 emission looks like in the past 200+ years:

![](/images/co2_emission.png "CO2 Emission")

Here's how the rate of rising temperature looks like in the past 200+ years:

![](/images/rising_temp.png "Rising Temperature Rate")

They're somehow correlated.

If we continue emitting GHG to the point that it's too hot for us to live in here, we might be doomed. Even before we reach such temperature, the rising sea is predicted to already bring impact by submerging coasts and lowlands, wreaking havoc on our world economy. (The latter is one of the biggest reasons the capitalists are starting to worry about temp rise).

So, **_why does it matter?_** This Earth we live in is our home. We live together in this piece of space rock; Earth's a shared living space for us all, we share the same atmosphere. What we do here might indirectly affect the other folks (or.. species) on the other side of the Earth. What we emit here today will impact some generations somewhere in the future; or probably our generation afterall. We will cause the future to suffer.

We humans were just around for the last 300.000 years; we started drawing walls as early as [52.000 years ago](https://web.archive.org/web/20191228180916/https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0679-9); started writing [5250 years ago](https://web.archive.org/web/20191029162232/https://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199935413.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199935413-e-61); and manufacturing stuff [200 years ago](https://web.archive.org/web/20200217005651/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_Revolution). Compared to the [timescale of the life itself](https://web.archive.org/web/20200109005433/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_human_evolution), we've just been around for [0.007% of the time](https://web.archive.org/web/20200207230239/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0yBzxC9eoog); and, out of stupidity, we're bringing disaster to this home of ours.
Don't we all want our species to last long; and maybe, be a [higher civilization](https://web.archive.org/web/20200204181805/https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/fermi-paradox.html)? At least I do.

A [friend](https://edom.github.io) of mine said:

**"Dinosaurs were _unlucky_, they're struck by disaster.
Humans are _stupid_, they make their own disaster"**

## Reducing carbon footprint

To reduce carbon footprint, we can do many things. Changing our diet, using public transport, hesitate to use excess electricity, insulate our homes with more efficient ones so that we use less energy to heat ourselves during winter, conscious buying and consumption, prefer trains over planes, and [many](https://web.archive.org/web/20200130093517/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_footprint#Ways_to_reduce_personal_carbon_footprint) many [more](https://web.archive.org/web/20200114221345/https://blogs.ei.columbia.edu/2018/12/27/35-ways-reduce-carbon-footprint/).

Thinking about it, doing them individually might be insignificant for the environment. But if we **collectively** do them together as a [humanity](https://web.archive.org/web/20200216082402/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyoto_Protocol), we might have a chance; at least to avoid the disaster. Not necessarily right now, but it is good for us to start doing those things we can to reduce our carbon footprint; the sooner the better. The [UN generously motivated us](https://www.un.org/press/en/2019/ga12131.doc.htm) to do it sooner.

I myself have started thinking about my own carbon footprint for years; and gradually changed lifestyle to reduce my own carbon footprint. I even ocasionally purposefully express dissent (in form of jokes, or words with joking tones) when my friends increases the ~~local entropy*~~ carbon emission. Why joking? Because I don't want to force others into doing what I suggest to. I want us all to consciously act for our future.

Let's do it.

_*I once really liked joking on this entropy thing with a friend. At the office, I filled half of my bottle with cold water, then the remaining half with hot water, then saying "fast forwarding to the heat death of the universe". What a dummy, hahaha. (I was working @airyrooms at the time)_

These are what I have done and what I have in my mental scratchpad.

- I still eat beef, but I noticed that I'm _eating less beef now._
  - There's the [Pescetarian](https://web.archive.org/web/20191001025951/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pescetarianism) diet I just knew recently. Probably I'll give it a try in the near future. _Sushi is really good afterall._
  - Or.. I can also stop eating beef but still eat other meat, moderately.
  - Or.. Go vegetarian? Probably not. But anyone else can start if they want to.
- Ride the bus to go to work.
- I still use planes to travel back home.
  - My hometown is over the seas, so I can't help it.
- Avoid plastics/paper bags/straws/etc.
  - They are single use.
  - _Paper turns out to be having multiple times more carbon footprint than plastic._
  - _I bring my own reusable bag and straws._
- Prefer walking if it's still walkable; ~2km.
- _Reduce AC_ usage.
  - I always put timers to AC when I sleep.
  - Also, use the fan at daytime.
- I'm planning to build a Desktop Gaming Rig.
  - Then I just realized (after reading one of the references here) that Laptops are way more energy friendly.
  - Maybe _I shouldn't spend time gaming afterall._
- Unplug unused electronics.
- Now I want to pay carbon taxes. But Indonesia has no such thing yet.
  - I wonder why? Probably the government's filled with owners of coal companies?
