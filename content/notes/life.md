  What is life? How do we end up happening here?

- What's life?
  - Combinations of natural atoms and molecules that somehow interact each other to form a set of functions to sustain themselves/keep themselves in the environment as long as possible. E.g. being able to tinker its surroundings to survive.
  - Formally they define/distinguish it from other entities by having [Biological Process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_process). But, there are no consensus on what it is.
  - Doesn't necessarily need to be intelligent.
- Why life?
  - No one knows.
  - To me, it's only a product of natural process. A product of probability.
      - [Murphy's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murphy%27s_law).
        - Anything that can ~~go wrong~~ happen will ~~go wrong~~ happen.
  - It is accidental, but inevitable in the universe.
  - It just happen to "be", here in earth.
- Where? Only in earth?
  - No one knows for sure.
  - We have no proof yet.
      - [JWST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Webb_Space_Telescope) might be able to gather more data to actually prove it.
  - Probability itself might show that might be there somewhere (in the past, at this point, or in the future) in the universe. See [Murphy's Law](#L14)
- When do life happen?
  - Here in this piece of rock (Earth), it might possibly start as early as [4.5 billion years ago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earliest_known_life_forms).
  - Anywhere in the universe, it might have happened long ago, now, or in the future.
- How do life happen?
  - There are [many theories](https://www.livescience.com/13363-7-theories-origin-life.html).
  - For life to happen, it must have began [without life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abiogenesis).
  - Personally I imagine life to begin when molecules of organic compounds accidentaly form a set of genetic codes that makes up a function, instructing it to survive, e.g. by copying itself and retain itself in the environment.
    - As those compounds copy, they also mutate, and add up in size of genetic code.
    - The mutations form other sets of functions, instructing them to do more complex inteactions with their surroundings.
    - Over time, the process repeats again and again, forming even more complex forms of functions. It will continuously happen, as the genetic code instructing it to survive is still there.
      - Or, new implementations (in form of genetic codes) of the function of "survival" might also happen to be in the process over time, providing redundancy.
    - We apes are the example of that process.
      - So is intelligence.
