title: Consciousness
---

Have you ever pondered about what you are? How you are aware of yourself and your surroundings? Pondering about that weird feeling of being trapped in this subjective self of yours, without being able to "get out"?
Have you ever wondered about what it feels to be inside the subjective self of, say, your close friends? Will it be the same experience as what [you are experiencing in your own self?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_Is_it_Like_to_Be_a_Bat)
Those crazy questions maybe arise because of our consciousness. What is consciousness anyway?

The dictionary defines [consciousness](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/consciousness) as "The state of being conscious or aware; awareness". It comes from the word [consciouss](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/conscious) which has several meaning, but this post is going to explore on one of its definitions: "Aware (having the knowledge) of one's own existence; aware of one's own awareness." So, this is going to be kinda existential of a post.
