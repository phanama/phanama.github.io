title: YPhanama's Notes
---

Here's my first post.

I'm a constant learner. I have interests on mostly anything!
Technology, Psychology, Biology, Physics, Space/Aerospace, Economics, Philosophy, you name it.

I'm doing tech things for a living.
Currently working as a Site Reliability Engineer @airyrooms.
AWS, Kubernetes, and Cloud Native technologies are my thing.

I made this site to write down my thoughts and rants on anything.

Regards,
Yudi A Phanama
