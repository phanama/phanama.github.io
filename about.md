I’m a constant learner. I have interests on mostly anything! Technology, Psychology, Biology, Physics, Space/Aerospace, Economics, Philosophy, you name it.

### More Information


I’m doing tech things for a living. Currently working as a Site Reliability Engineer @airyrooms. AWS, Kubernetes, and Cloud Native technologies are my thing.

I made this site to write down my thoughts and rants on anything.

Regards, Yudi A Phanama
